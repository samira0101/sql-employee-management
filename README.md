# sql-employee-management

Building an employee management in SQL2 (project)

# Description - Why did build an employee management?
The main purpose to build this Node application is so that the bussiness ownder can view and manage the departments, roles and employees that are in their company, enabling to organise through the terminal.

This project has enhanced my skills in Node. Additional knowledge gained includes: Node (inquirer, Mysql2, Console.table), switch statement, .prompt, return, connection.end, on top of previous acquired javascript skills.

# What does this project do? and how?

The user is able to respond to the questions/options asked in the terminal which enables the user to add information in the table provided by the databes. 

The following installation was required inquirer, Mysql2, Console.table. You need to run npm install in the root directory to download these dependencies, SQL interface is also required. To do this you will need to change directory into the db folder (cd db) in terminal then follow with mysql -u root. 

To be able to view the database in the terminal you will need to be in the main directory and type node app.js.
